# PiTona
Welcome to the PiTona project! This project is an educational project to learn more about the OBD2
protocol and the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) microprocessor.

Currently, this project is still very much in a pre-alpha phase. Please check back later. 

## Disclaimer
Use this project at your own risk. There is a very real possibility that sending OBD2 commands,
without an understanding of what they do, will result in a broken ECU. This project is not
malicious in any way, shape, or form... however, I will not be held responsible for any damage,
issues, or other problems that might arise from the use of this software.
